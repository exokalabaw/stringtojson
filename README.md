# extract specific data from long string pasted from a pdf
I was given data as a PDF. It copy and pasted as one long string and the information dates were all jumbled up. 

Example string from the data"

'$83.97 Mar 28, 2021, 1:54 PM MST $60.18 Mar 28, 2021, 10:46 AM MST $55.75 Mar 22, 2021, 12:28 AM MST'

I needed to:
1. Extract each into an object.
2. Convert the timezone to pacific
3. Arrange the data in chronological order
